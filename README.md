## Troubleshooting

### Memory Issues

If you encounter memory-related errors such as:

```
There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue.
```

Solutions:

- Increase the heap size using JVM options:
  ```
  -Xms512m -Xmx2048m
  ```
- Reduce the number of threads or decrease thread stack sizes (`-Xss`).
- Ensure sufficient physical RAM and swap space are available.
